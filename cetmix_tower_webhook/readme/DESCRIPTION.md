This module implements incoming webhooks for [Cetmix Tower](https://tower.cetmix.com). Webhooks are authorised using customisable authenticators which can be pre-configured and reused across multiple webhooks. Webhooks and authenticators can be exported and imported using YAML format, which makes them easily sharable.

This module is a part of Cetmix Tower, however it can be used to manage any other odoo applications.

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://tower.cetmix.com) for detailed information.
