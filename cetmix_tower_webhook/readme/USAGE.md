When a request is received, Cetmix Tower will search for the webhook with the matching endpoint and authenticate the request using the selected authenticator. In case of successful authentication webhook code is run. Each webhook call is logged. Logs are available under the  "Cetmix Tower > Logs > Webhook Calls" menu or under the "Logs" button directly in the Webhook.

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://tower.cetmix.com) for detailed usage instructions.
